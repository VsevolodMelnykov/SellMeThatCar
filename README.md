# SellMeThatCar
This is the university project (thus is incomplete and I think on going further with it). 

The task was to create imitation of any type of Auction (imitation means it had to run on 1 PC and don't use any internet connection, thus all we could do was to serealize it).

THe visual part of the project is simple since I was targeting getting as many of required criterias into project as possible, I think on upgrading it as well (as well as adding photos, uploading all to database, etc)

The auction chosen is reverse (where buyer requests a car and sellers compete for the best price for the buyer)

I find the structure of the project unnecessarily extended, but it had to be done for completing requirements for the project
